# PHYMOL kick-off conference 2023: hands-on workshops
If you wish to participate in the tutorials please do the SAPT tutorial and the schnet\_tutorial before the workshops. These tutorials simply create the conda environments that will be used in the workshops. Note that it could take ~ 1 hour to do all the installations, especially for conda to resolve the correct setup for the SAPT tutorial.
