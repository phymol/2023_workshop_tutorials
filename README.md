# PHYMOL kick-off conference 2023: Hands-on workshops
These are hands-on tutorials that are designed to be done on your laptops (the tutorials will be held in the BS 0.03 auditorium which does not have computers). If you wish to participate in the tutorials, please do the SAPT tutorial setup and the ml tutorial setup step before the workshops to setup anaconda virtual environments. Note that it could take ~1 hour to do all the installations, especially for conda to resolve the correct setup for the SAPT tutorial.

You can find the video recording of the SAPT tutorial given by Prof. Patkowski at https://youtu.be/jd465Jy5sHQ
