# PHYMOL kick-off conference 2023: Hands-on workshops
These are hands-on tutorials that are designed to be done on your laptops (the tutorials will be held in the BS 0.03 auditorium which does not have computers). If you wish to participate in the tutorials, please do the SAPT tutorial and the schnet\_tutorial setup instructions before the workshops to setup anaconda virtual environments. Note that it could take ~1 hour to do all the installations, especially for conda to resolve the correct setup for the SAPT tutorial.

The schnet tutorial is a smaller, minorly tweaked version of the schnet tutorial found in the schnet pack github https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack 
You are highly encouraged to go there to see fuller explanations and more things you can do with schnetpack.
