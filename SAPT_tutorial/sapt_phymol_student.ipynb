    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will examine some properties of weak interactions between molecules. As the molecular subunits are not connected by any covalent (or ionic) bonds, we often use the term *noncovalent interactions*. Suppose we want to calculate the interaction energy between molecule A and molecule B for a certain geometry of the A-B complex (obviously, this interaction energy depends on how far apart the molecules are and how they are oriented). The simplest way of doing so is by subtraction (in the so-called *supermolecular approach*):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E_{\\rm int}=E_{\\rm A-B}-E_{\\rm A}-E_{\\rm B}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_{\\rm X}$ is the total energy of system X, computed using our favorite electronic structure theory and basis set. A negative value of $E_{\\rm int}$ means that A and B have a lower energy when they are together than when they are apart, so they do form a weakly bound complex that might be stable at least at very low temperatures. A positive value of $E_{\\rm int}$ means that the A-B complex is unbound - it is energetically favorable for A and B to go their separate ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example of two interacting helium atoms and calculate $E_{\\rm int}$ at a few different interatomic distances $R$. You will use Psi4 to calculate the total energies that you need to perform subtraction. When you do so for a couple different $R$, you will be able to sketch the *potential energy curve* - the graph of $E_{\\rm int}(R)$ as a function of $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, but how should you pick the electronic structure method to calculate $E_{\\rm A-B}$, $E_{\\rm A}$, and $E_{\\rm B}$? Let's start with the simplest choice and try out the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. In case HF is not accurate enough, we will also try the coupled-cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations - CCSD(T). If you haven't heard about CCSD(T) before, let's just state that it is **(1)** usually very accurate (it's even called the *gold standard* of electronic structure theory) and **(2)** very expensive for larger molecules. For the basis set, let's pick the augmented correlation consistent triple-zeta (aug-cc-pVTZ) basis of Dunning which should be quite OK for both HF and CCSD(T).\n"

Your friend suggests to use CCSD(T) only for the easier terms $E_{\\rm A}$ and $E_{\\rm B}$ and subtract them from $E_{\\rm A-B}$ calculated with a different, cheaper method such as HF.

    "A nice feature of the supermolecular approach is that it is very easy to use - you just need to run three standard energy calculations, and modern quantum chemistry codes such as Psi4 give you a lot of methods to choose from. However, the accuracy of subtraction hinges on error cancellation, and we have to be careful to ensure that the errors do cancel between $E_{\\rm A-B}$ and $E_{\\rm A}+E_{\\rm B}$. Another drawback of the supermolecular approach is that it is not particularly rich in physical insight. All that we get is a single number $E_{\\rm int}$ that tells us very little about the underlying physics of the interaction. Therefore, one may want to find an alternative approach where $E_{\\rm int}$ is computed directly, without subtraction, and it is obtained as a sum of distinct, physically meaningful terms. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) is such an alternative approach.\n",

Contrary to the supermolecular approach, SAPT obtains the interaction energy directly - no subtraction of similar terms is needed. Moreover, the result is obtained as a sum of separate corrections accounting for the electrostatic, induction, dispersion, and exchange contributions to interaction energy, so the SAPT decomposition facilitates the understanding and physical interpretation of results.\n",

We now have many more degrees of freedom: in addition to the intermolecular distance $R$, we can change the relative orientation of two molecules, or even their internal geometries (O-H bond lengths and H-O-H angles). In this way, the potential energy curve becomes a multidimensional *potential energy surface*. It is hard to graph functions of more than two variables, so we will stick to the distance dependence of the interaction energies. Therefore, we will assume one particular orientation of two water molecules (a hydrogen-bonded one) and vary the intermolecular distance $R$ while keeping the orientation, and molecular geometries, constant.

    "Our SAPT calculations so far have been done at the simplest **SAPT0** level. This is great for some qualitative insight and for making ternary diagrams, but the SAPT0 approximation is too crude for quantitative accuracy. Fortunately, Psi4 supports a bunch of more accurate SAPT variants that include *intramolecular electron correlation*. This can be accomplished in several different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first possibility is getting intramolecular correlation effects through a second perturbation theory, very much like in the Møller–Plesset expansion for each molecule. Depending on which additional corrections you include, this approach leads to a family of SAPT levels, starting from SAPT0 and continuing through SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), up to the most sophisticated SAPT2+3 level. Here, we will recalculate the water dimer potential curve using **SAPT2+(3)**, which is much more accurate than SAPT0. Each calculation will take a couple of seconds, so we will add a printout to know how far along we are. Once all data are in, we will make the same graph as we did for SAPT0 before."
